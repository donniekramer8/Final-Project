# Final-Project

This is the code for my final project in Data Structures.

I'm building this program with the goal that it will be able to predict whether a gene is present or not within a sample of bacterial DNA. Bacterial DNA is easiest because it lacks introns. If I find that I complete this project sooner than anticipated, I may try it with the more challenging eukaryotic DNA.

The program has several requirements:
1. 2 Data structures used (maybe?)
2. A sorting algorithm (done)
3. A GUI (maybe?)
